	Long: `
aznum2words-cli is a CLI tool that is designed to convert positive or negative numbers - integers, floating-point into word representation in the Azerbaijani language.

Use cases:
There are many use cases where the word representation of numbers is useful or even necessary in real life. 

Here are a few examples:
- Legal and financial documents: Legal and financial documents often require the use of the word representation of numbers to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy.
- Check writing: When writing a check, it is common practice to write out the word representation of the amount in addition to the numerical amount to prevent alterations or fraud.
- Customer service: Customer service representatives may need to verbally communicate the word representation of a number to a customer over the phone, particularly when dealing with complex or technical issues.
- Education: In education, the word representation of numbers is often used to teach children how to spell numbers and reinforce their understanding of place value.
